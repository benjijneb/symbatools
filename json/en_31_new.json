Demonologists know how to summon daemons to the world of the living, and can force them into service. These daemons come in three different forms and the summoning of each requires the use of a separate ritual, but since the procedures share many characteristics they are described together. Irrespective of the type of daemon to be summoned, the procedure is the same: the creature must appear within a symbol prepared on the ground, and wise demonologists make sure to learn, and use, the ritual Magic Circle in order to protect themselves if something goes wrong during the summoning. Summoning a daemon requires no test to be rolled once the special symbol has been created; however, in order to subdue the daemon and make it obey the demonologist, a test against [Resolute←Resolute] must be passed. A blood sacrifice in the form of a living Cultural Being gives the mystic a second chance to pass the test, and if the victim has no permanent corruption the mystic also gains a +1 bonus on the test. If the test is successful, the daemon does the mystic a service; if the test fails, the daemon is free to do whatever it wishes until the same time next day. The creature cannot stay longer than that unless it is bound to the service of the demonologist. Whether or not the daemon is bound to the mystic, it can never enter magic circles, witch circles or a site protected by Sanctum. The demonologist may only bind one daemon at a time; if more are summoned, the one already bound is freed and will remain in the world for twenty-four hours before returning to its place of origin. However, if the mystic knows more than one of the summoning rituals, he or she can have one daemon of each type in service. The three rituals let the mystic summon a specific type of daemon – either a Vindictive, a Knowledgeable or a Guardian daemon.
